# Documentation

This directory contains both the user and the developer documentation. 

The directory `user` contains the source of the user documentation, which can
be either consulted via GitHub itself, since it can render reStructuredText,
or it can be consulted in PDF or HTML form after it is compiled.

The developer guide is stored in 
(developer-guide.md)[https://github.com/lupino3/edumips64/blob/master/docs/developer-guide.md].
