EduMIPS64 README
================

EduMIPS64 is a cross-platform visual MIPS64 CPU simulator written in
Java/swing. To learn how it works and how to use it, please refer to the
EduMIPS64 User Manual (in the docs/{en,it}/output/latex directory). This file
is a short guide for developers.

Requirements
------------

In order to compile EduMIPS64, you need the following tools:
- Java JDK version 1.5 or above (tested only with Sun JDK)
- Apache Ant version 1.8 or above (needed for JUnit 4 tests)

If you need to compile the in-application help, you need:
- Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) versione 1.0.7 or above
- GNU Make

If you need to compile the PDF manual, you will also need:
- latex / pdflatex

If you need to run unit tests, you will also need:
- JUnit version 4

Main Ant targets
----------------

* `jar` build the EduMIPS64 jar package named edumips64-`version`.jar

* `debugjar` build a jar package that contains more debug information

* `clijar` build a jar package containing an experimental CLI front-end to
  EduMIPS64

* `src-release` builds a tar.bz2 file containing the source distribution of
  EduMIPS64

* `tests` runs unit tests; it depends on junit4.jar being added to the
  CLASSPATH environment variable

* `clean` removes the jar files and the build directory

Building the user documentation
-------------------------------

To build the documentation, as stated before, you need sphinx >= 1.0.7,
GNU/Make and a working installation of latex and pdflatex.

The user docs come in two different languages: english (en) and italian (it).

First, cd to the directory containing the sources of the doc to rebuild:

$ cd docs/en/src # or docs/it/src for italian

Then use the following make targets:

* `html` to build the in-app help

* `latexpdf` to build the pdf manual.

Building the developer documentation
------------------------------------

To build the javadoc documentation, use the `javadoc` target. It also depends
on junit being in the CLASSPATH, and will store the resulting HTML javadoc in
the `javadoc` directory.
