				     EduMIPS64 RELEASE NOTES	
				     http://www.edumips.org

EduMIPS64 is a GPL porting to Java Swing of the MIPS64 instruction set 
simulator WinMIPS64

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the third public release of EduMIPS64. 

The BIG changes from EduMIPS64 are the new error dialogs, that make
debugging easier, and the "Stop execution" feature, that solves the
awful "infinite loop" bug.

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)
