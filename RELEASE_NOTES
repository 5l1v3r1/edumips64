EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is version 1.2.2 of EduMIPS64, a bug-fix release that follows up on
version 1.2.1, that was released a few weeks ago. The codename for this
release is "Contrada Fumata", since it is being released from a nice country
house in Contrada Fumata, near Adrano.

This release mostly fixes one bug with the JR/JALR instructions, that didn't
properly respect RAW stalls.

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.
