EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is version 1.2.1 of EduMIPS64, a bug-fix release that follows up on
version 1.2, that was released almost 3 years ago. The codename for this
release is "IFSC", since it is being released from a nice apartment in IFSC,
Dublin 1.

Most of the code was written in Portobello, Dublin 8, a few airports around
the world and - of course - IFSC.

This release mostly fixes minor issues, listed later, and contains several
internal changes made in these 3 years to improve the code quality.

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub.
