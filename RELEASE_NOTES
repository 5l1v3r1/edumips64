				     EduMIPS64 RELEASE NOTES	
				     http://www.edumips.org

EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the fourth public release of EduMIPS64. 

Many features have been added since last version, and the product went through
many development release before this public stable version.

From now on, development will use SVN, so that development releases will be made
available to the public not only via www.edumips.org, but even via
SourceForge.org.

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)

If you find a bug, please send us a bug report to

	edumips64-devel@lists.sourceforge.net (requires subscription)

If you don't want to subscribe, send the bug report to bugs@edumips.org.
